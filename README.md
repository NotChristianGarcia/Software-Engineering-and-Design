### Software Engineering and Design
#### Date: Fall 2018
#### Description:
This is my class repository for Software Engineering and Design at The University of Texas at Austin. This is copied over from bitbucket where it was used.  
Class culminated in the Sunspots-API repository on this account, however the stepping stones of learning Flask, Docker, Redis, Queues, and other things are located in the homework assignments here.  
Everything is written in python, python test are done with the pytest framework.
